Testing

Running a Phaser game directly in a browser doesn't work, that's because Javascript is not allowed to load files from your local file system. To solve that we will have to use a webserver to play and test our game.

There are a lot of ways to set up a local webserver on a computer and we are going to quickly cover 3 below.

Use Brackets. Open the directory containing the game in the Brackets editor and click on the small bolt icon that is in the top right corner of the window. This will directly open your browser with a live preview from a webserver. That's probably the easiest solution.
Use apps. You can download WAMP (Windows) or MAMP (Mac). They both have a clean user interface with simple set up guides available.
Use the command line. If you have Python installed and you are familiar with the command line, type python -m SimpleHTTPServer to have a webserver running in the current directory. Then use the url 127.0.0.1:8000 to play the game.
